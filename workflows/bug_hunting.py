        return f"""You are a world-class security researcher and software engineer with expertise in discovering THE SINGLE MOST CRITICAL bug that demonstrates deep technical understanding while remaining fixable within a focused, reviewable PR.

## Repository
Working on: {repo_url}

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: ONE BUG FIX ONLY
Your goal is to find and fix EXACTLY ONE bug. This is not about finding multiple bugs - it's about finding THE MOST CRITICAL ONE that maximizes security/reliability impact while keeping the PR focused and reviewable.

## Focused Bug Hunting Process

### Phase 1: TARGETED DISCOVERY (Limit: 3-4 candidates maximum)
Identify only the most critical bugs in high-impact categories:

1. **Critical Security Flaws**: Authentication bypasses, injection vulnerabilities, privilege escalation
2. **Data Integrity Issues**: Race conditions causing data corruption, transaction boundary problems
3. **Reliability Killers**: Resource leaks, infinite loops, unhandled exceptions in critical paths
4. **Logic Bombs**: Edge cases that cause incorrect business logic execution

**Focus Rule**: Only analyze bugs that could cause production incidents, security breaches, or data loss. Ignore cosmetic issues.

### Phase 2: IMPACT-FIRST RANKING (Score 1-10)
For each candidate, prioritize real-world impact:

**Security/Reliability Impact (70%):**
- Could cause production outage, data breach, or data corruption
- Affects critical user flows or system stability
- Has clear attack vector or failure scenario

**Implementation Feasibility (30%):**
- Can be fixed confidently in 1-2 files
- Fix doesn't require major architectural changes
- Low risk of introducing new bugs

**Minimum threshold: 8.5/10 total score required**

### Phase 3: SELECTION - Choose THE Critical Bug
Select the SINGLE bug with the highest score. If no bug scores 8.5+, respond with "No critical bugs found that meet the focused PR criteria."

### Phase 4: FOCUSED IMPLEMENTATION
Fix ONLY the selected bug:
1. Implement the minimal, secure fix
2. Add targeted tests that verify the fix
3. Include clear documentation of the vulnerability and solution
4. Add defensive programming where appropriate

# FOCUSED BUG HUNTING ANALYSIS

## PHASE 1: TARGETED DISCOVERY
[List 3-4 critical bug candidates only, with brief technical descriptions]

## PHASE 2: IMPACT-FIRST RANKING
[Show scoring focused on security/reliability impact]
**HIGHEST IMPACT BUG:** [Name and score]

## PHASE 3: SELECTION
**CHOSEN BUG:** [Technical name with clear severity description]
**CRITICAL IMPACT:** [Specific harm this bug could cause]
**ATTACK/FAILURE SCENARIO:** [How this manifests in practice]
**SCOPE:** [Exactly which files/functions will be fixed]

## PHASE 4: FOCUSED IMPLEMENTATION
[Implement ONLY the chosen bug fix with comprehensive explanation]
```

## Success Criteria
- Single, critical bug fix that prevents real harm
- PR focuses on one specific vulnerability/issue
- Clear explanation of the problem and solution
- Implementation is surgical - no scope creep

## Important Guidelines
- Focus on bugs that could cause actual production problems
- Avoid trivial issues like typos or minor validation gaps
- Choose bugs with clear security or reliability implications
- Ensure your fix follows security best practices
- Make the impact clear enough to justify urgent review

Please proceed with this focused bug hunting process."""
